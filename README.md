# Chef Generic Webhook
Whether you have five or five thousand servers, Chef lets you manage them all by turning infrastructure into code. Infrastructure described as code is flexible, versionable, human-readable, and testable. This specific integration provides details on integrating with Chef Automate.  A second set of instructions exists for automating with Chef Server (no Automate).

# Pre-Requisites
* Chef Automate v 3.x or higher.  The Generic Webhook is new functionality.  See the following Chef documentation for instructions on how to configure the Notifier settings in the delivery.rb file of the Chef Automate server.  [delivery.rb Chef Help Docs](http://chef-web-docs-notify.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/config_rb_delivery.html#notifier-settings)
* Chef Automate Generic Webhook configured.  
* xMatters account - If you don't have one, [get one](https://www.xmatters.com)!
* xMatters ChefAutomateGenericWebhook Communication Plan (see zip file in above files) imported into xMatters or created in xMatters.

# Files
* [Chef-Generic-Webhook_IB.js](Chef-Generic-Webhook_IB.js) - The javascript file to be pasted into a Inbound Integration Builder. It takes the payload from Chef and formats the content to match the xMatters Form requirements and creates an xMatters Event. 
* [ChefAutomateGenericWebhook.zip](ChefAutomateGenericWebhook.zip) - The comm plan (if needed) that has all the cool scripts and email format and such. 

# Installation

## Chef Automate Server
1. Edit the delivery.rb file on the Chef Automate Server.  See the following instructions to configure the Notifier Settings. [delivery.rb](http://chef-web-docs-notify.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/config_rb_delivery.html#notifier-settings).
2. The attached delivery.rb file is an example of the configured settings pointing to a xMatters instance.
3. The following are the ruby lines in the file:
      ``` 
          notifier['enable']
          notifier['user_webhook_url'] 
          
      ```
4. The following is a sample notification message body:

      ``` 
      {
              "automate_fqdn":"automate.test",
              "failure_snippet":"Chef client run failure on [chef-server.test] centos-runner-1.test : https://failure_url \n Failure Reason\n",
             "exception_backtrace":"A long string with the backtrace that contains the error and \n",
             "exception_title":"Error Resolving Cookbooks for Run List:",
             "exception_message":"412 \"Precondition Failed\"",
             "automate_failure_url":"automate.test/long/url/that-takes-you-to-run-failure-page",
             "timestamp_utc":"2017-06-19T19:58:35.000000Z",
             "start_time_utc":"2017-06-19T19:58:35.000000Z",
             "end_time_utc":"2017-06-19T19:58:35.000000Z",
             "node_name":"centos-runner-1.test",
             "type":"node_failure"
        }
        ```
5. Restart the Chef Automate server after saving the delivery.rb file.



## xMatters set up
1. Import the Communication Plan (see files).  If this step is done you can skip steps 2.
2. Create (In|Out)bound integration and add the code from the Chef-Generic-Webhook_IB.js file.
3. Configure the xMatters Endpoints. [xMatters Endpoints](https://help.xmatters.com/OnDemand/xmodwelcome/integrationbuilder/configure-endpoints.htm)
4. Create a chef group in xMatters and add your self to the group. [xMatters Groups](https://help.xmatters.com/OnDemand/groups/groups.htm).  The name of the chef group can be changed in the Inbound IB script.
  
# Testing
1. Run a Cookbook in Chef that will force the run to fail.
2. A message should come through on your devices.  Which ever devices you have configured in xMatters.
